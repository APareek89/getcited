Be suspicious: these systems answer differently every single run — anyone quoting a guaranteed lift from a non-deterministic system is selling you the variance. The sharpest criticism of AI visibility tools is that they hide their methods — undisclosed prompt lists, unknown run counts, opaque scoring — and then headline guaranteed lifts. GetCited was built as the rebuttal. Every projection is a modeled estimate with its assumptions stated and a confidence rating attached. Every panel run is labeled for what it is — a single-run snapshot, reported as directional. And the methodology behind your numbers is disclosed, not hidden — because a measurement you can't interrogate is a measurement you can't trust."
